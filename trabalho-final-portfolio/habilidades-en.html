                                <p> I hadn't the opportunity to use it professionally,
                                    but I have already tested it by creating a simple application. Jetpack Compose is a UI
                                    declarative library for the development of Android applications that allows the creation
                                    of modern and dynamic user interfaces with less
                                    code.</p>

                        <p>The first programming language I came into contact with in life was the C language, when I started my studies in algorithms and programming logic, but it did not go beyond this introductory view and the execution of college assignments. The knowledge base in algorithm and programming logic were adding up as I met other languages but much of what I knew at that time of syntax was lost due to lack of frequent practice. I programmed a database with SQL in college and you can say that I bumped into Python. And at this moment I am using HTML which is a markup language, using CSS to style these web pages that you are reading now and FlexBox to allow positioning and responsiveness of this site which is also academic knowledge.</p>

                        <p>Already in my professional performance counting from the internship in a company I was able to act with Java, Kotlin both programming languages and XML as a markup language. These are the most common languages in native Android development. you can say that of my total time as a programmer in the market 50% I acted with Java and the rest with Kotlin as programming languages for Android.</p>

                        <h3>Java</h3>
                        <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language and is one of the most used languages by companies today in the development of WEB and Mobile applications.</p>

                        <h3>Kotlin</h3>
                        <p>Kotlin is an open source multiplatform programming language created by JetBrains and widely used by Android developers. It is multiparadigm, being fully object-oriented, but with some characteristics of functional language (such as lambda functions), with static typing and executed by the Java Virtual Machine.</p>

                        <h3>XML</h3>
                        <p>XML is a recommendation from W3C to generate markup languages for special needs. It is one of the subtypes of SGML capable of describing various types of data. Its main purpose is the ease of sharing information through the internet.</p>
                        <h3>Other languages</h3>
                        <p>I already had a brief contact with C, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Dart, Python, and Ruby.</p>

                    <h1>Software architecture</h1>

                    <p>During my performance with Android coding I had the opportunity to deal with different ways of structuring project codes and even different implementations of the same architecture. But the one that was most frequent in the vast majority of projects that I worked on were clean architecture and MVVM.</p>

                    <h3>Clean Architecture</h3>

                    <p>It is a software architecture proposed by Robert Cecil Martin (or Uncle Bob, as he is better known) that aims to standardize and organize the code developed, favor its reusability, as well as technology independence. Although Clean Architecture was created in mid-2012, it is full of timeless principles that can be applied regardless of the technology used and programming language.</p>

                    <h3>MVVM</h3>

                    <p>MVVM is a software development architecture pattern based on Model, View and View-Model. Meet the three main elements below: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Model:</b> the model layer is the business logic that drives the application;
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>View:</b> it is the user interface.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>ViewModel:</b> the ViewModel layers coordinate operations between the view and the model layers, in addition, it will evoke operations on the Model layer when necessary.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Such a model was created by the software architect of WPF and Silverlight from Microsoft, John Grossman in 2005. Since then, it has been used mainly in mobile development.</p>

                    <h3>MVI</h3>

                    <p>The MVI architecture, acronym for Model-View-Intent, is a specific architectural pattern for the development of Android applications. It stands out for following a unidirectional data flow approach and emphasizing the separation of responsibilities and immutability to create scalable, maintainable and testable code. In MVI, the Model maintains the state of the application and processes the events, the View displays the state and emits events (Intents) to the Model, and the Intent defines the action that the user performs on the View. This structure promotes more organized state management and facilitates debugging. </p>
