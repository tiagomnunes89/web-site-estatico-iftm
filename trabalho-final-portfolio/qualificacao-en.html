                        <p>It was a time of much study,
                            preparation and
                            I worked effectively on tasks
                            about various stages of production in an
                            application that was awarded. Full
                            android team and native application. I grew a lot
                            technically.</p>

                        <p>Through an internal selection process, I worked
                            on a project to develop an
                            Open Source solution - Server Driven UI.
                            I improved my knowledge in Android,
                            dealing with customization of components,
                            design system and backend. I performed tasks
                            about all stages of building an
                            application and used the most used technologies.</p>

                        <p>I worked on the development of a library that uses Blockchain concepts
                            at CPQD. This innovative idea aims to improve the way of validating identity and accessing
                            data in

                            implementation of new features in
                            a B2B app for one of the largest banks

                        <h4>ANDROID DEVELOPER - Senior (Jan 2023 - Present)</h4>
                        <p>I work on the core team of the SuperApp Magalu Android, which boasts over 100 million
                            downloads.
                            In addition to implementing features and fixing bugs, I am dedicated to enhancing the
                            architecture and modularization.
                            I use Hilt and have migrated from Dagger 2 to dependency injection (DI) in the modules.
                            My responsibilities include refactoring code, providing support, developing services, and
                            making improvements
                            in mini-apps (a type of customizable webview). I also actively promote the adoption of
                            development standards. As part of my role,
                            I handle tests and performance optimization. I contribute to a mono repo multi-modular
                            project with an MVI architecture.
                            This involves managing environments using Flavors and Build Variants, all while adhering to
                            agile methodologies.
                            Our documentation is maintained in Confluence. Within the team, we regularly exchange
                            technical knowledge.
                            Additionally, I’ve had the opportunity to present topics at BEV and Android Sync events
                            outside the team.</p>

                    <p>I am able to communicate in English with both native speakers and non-native speakers. I have
                        completed the advanced
                        I and II modules of the English course at CENID, which is equivalent to an intermediate level in
                        the international
                        classification. To further enhance my language skills, I regularly use apps to expand my
                        vocabulary
                        like ELSA Speak to refine my pronunciation. According to the ELSA Speak app, I was classified as
                        advanced level with an average
                        score of 81%, taking into account pronunciation (82%), fluency (74%), intonation (74%), word
                        stress (98%), and listening (95%). Moreover,
                        I frequently engage in conversations with native and fluent English speakers through voice
                        messages, calls, chatting,
                        and video calls using platforms like the Tandem app and iTalki.

                        <p>Before beginning my current IT course, I successfully completed the selection process and
                            started two other degree programs
                            at the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU). These programs were in Information Systems
                            and Computer Science, both of which
                            are excellent courses but didn’t quite align with my focus. Eventually, I discovered a
                            course at the
                            Federal Institute of Triângulo Mineiro that truly captivated me. It was a practical and
                            efficient program,
                            covering everything I wanted to learn and tailored to meet market demands. I completed the
                            course feeling
                            very satisfied with the knowledge I gained and the opportunities it has already provided
                            me.</p>
